    "# Sales Analysis For Northwind Traders' Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Northwind Traders is a food distribution company. Its history of operations is tracked in its [database found here](https://github.com/pthom/northwind_psql/tree/master) and includes information relating to four key areas: employee performance, monthly and yearly sales data and growth, consumer purchasing behaviour, and product sales and categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to analyze these key areas to help Northwind Traders' management make strong, data-backed decisions and answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which employees should be rewarded/provided support based on performance, and how can rankings promote healthy competition and better sales?\n",
    "2. What are monthly and yearly sales growth trends?\n",
    "3. How can the highest-spending and lowest-spending customers be identified to determine appropriate engagement incentives?\n",
    "4. What are the top products and how can inventory for these be optimized?\n",
    "    \n",
    "After running the data analysis, I found the top performing employees by sales rank; Northwind Traders' running total of sales and month-over-month sales growth rate; engagement levels of customers' orders, ranked by percentile; and the highest performing categories, individual products within each category, and individual products overall. All tables summarizing this data will prove invaluable for Northwind Traders to optimize its operations and continue strong growth into the future with data-backed decisions and business strategies.\n"

    "### Employee Sales Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the first question, I join the `employees` table with the `orders` and `order_details` tables to link each employee with their respective sales performance. I defined each employee's total sales as the sum of the revenue from all the orders they handle, and determined this first with an `employee_sales` Common Table Expression (CTE). This allowed me to then query the employees' data and rank them by their total sales."

    "The most popular products that Northwind Traders sells are listed above. This table provides a more macro view of product performance rather than limiting them to just their categories. Using the percentile ranking, the company will also be able to quantitively identify strong and poor performers. This will allow for constant re-stocking for the top percentile products, and initiatives such as discounts on the bottom 20th percentile products to sell them out before their expiration dates."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I answered the four questions posed at the beginning of the project to help Northwind Traders streamline its operations. I ranked employees by their sales performance to help management deduce ways of promoting healthy competition. I also took on a more macro view of sales performance by tabulating the running total of sales and month-by-month sales growth rate, allowing for easy identification of macro trends. I then ordered customers by percentile of their order contributions to sales, making it simple for management to engage, reward, and retain customers, and took a deep look at specific products and categories that perform the strongest to ensure their inventory optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, all of the data will allow Northwind Traders to continue making strong, data-backed decisions for a long-term strategy that helps continues its history of growth."
